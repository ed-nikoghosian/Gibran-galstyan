            The essence of Life is the diversity of Existence in Reality. And this choice is carried out by any
            Substantia in their own created "World" or Reality. But Substantia is the eternity, infiniteness in the
            Emptiness: revelation, revelation, revelationâ€¦ Once in my past I appeared in the middle of this peculiar
            "revelation" and "Reality". I was standing in front of the "Light". In my world it was a phenomenon upon
            which no one ever deliberated. It was there, it was an existence independent of us and inside us. It was our
            friend but sometimes also our unwanted visitor which no one saw, heard and moreover spoke to. And, thus,
            with the help of a female guide, all of a sudden, I appeared before this "Light". And, imagine, it turned
            into a peculiar mirror, into a superdense and surprisingly viscous substance. I couldn"t resist the
            temptation and unconsciously tried to touch it, feel it, penetrate "it" and, finally, found myself in an
            emptiness.
